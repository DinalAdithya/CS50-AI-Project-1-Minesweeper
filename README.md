# Minesweeper AI
This project implements an AI to play the classic Minesweeper game, built as part of Harvard's **CS50 AI** course. The AI uses logical reasoning and probability to identify mines and make optimal moves.

## Features
- Simulates the Minesweeper game with a customizable board size.
- Implements AI to deduce the location of mines using logic and probabilities.
- Provides a step-by-step demonstration of the AI's decision-making process.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the `minesweeper.py` script using Python.
3. Observe the AI as it identifies safe moves and flags mines.

## Learning Highlights
- Gained experience in logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction problems.
- Learned to implement probability-based decision-making in AI.
- Explored the development of game-playing algorithms and optimization strategies.
